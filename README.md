Making consistent, high-quality espresso requires careful control of temperature and pressure. Unfortunately, the Rancilio Silvia espresso machine I have uses a simple thermostat and "bang bang" control. With the help of a Raspberry Pi, a thermocouple (for temp measurement), and this repo, I can introduce PID logic to actuate the boiler more effectively. Also, I can post MQTT status messages over WiFi.
